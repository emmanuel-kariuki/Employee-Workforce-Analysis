# Employee-Workforce-Analysis
High employee turnover disrupts productivity and increases hiring costs. This project analyzes employee records to identify key attrition drivers and provide data-driven retention strategies. 

# Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of an employee dataset to uncover key workforce trends and behaviors. The goal was to transform raw data into actionable business insights that can inform strategic Human Resources (HR) decisions, improve employee well-being, and optimize talent management.

The analysis focuses on understanding workforce demographics, compensation, tenure, and, most importantly, identifying patterns in leave-taking behavior that may signal underlying issues.

# Research Questions
The analysis was guided by the following core questions:

Workforce Composition: What is the distribution of employees by educational qualification, gender, and age?

Tenure & Experience: How does employee tenure vary across different cities, and what is the relationship between Payment Tier and Experience Years?

Leave-Taking Behavior: Are there any identifiable patterns in leave-taking among employees based on their city, education, payment tier, gender, or whether they've been benched?

# üõ† Tools & Skills
- SQL: Data cleaning and querying
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards and data visualization
- Data storytelling: Translating analysis into business recommendations

# üîç Approach
1. Cleaned and structured data using SQL.
2. Segmented attrition by location, job role, and pay tier.
3. Built Power BI dashboards to visualize attrition trends.

# Key Findings & Insights
The analysis yielded several critical insights:

Significant Geographic Disparity in Leave Rates: The Pune office has a remarkably higher leave rate (50.9%) compared to Bangalore and New Delhi, indicating potential localized issues requiring immediate attention.

Compensation Tier Correlates with Leave: Employees in Payment Tier 2 exhibit a substantially higher leave rate (60.2%) than those in other tiers, suggesting unique stressors or dissatisfaction within this group.

Gender and Education Patterns: Female employees and those with a Master's degree show a greater tendency to take leave compared to their counterparts.

No Linear Correlation between Pay and Experience: There is a negligible linear relationship between Payment Tier and Experience Years, suggesting that compensation is determined by factors other than just domain experience.

# Actionable Recommendations
Based on these findings, the following actions are recommended:

Targeted Assessment: Conduct a localized HR assessment in the Pune office to identify and address the root causes of the high leave rate.

Tier 2 Investigation: Initiate a deeper review into the factors affecting employees in Payment Tier 2, such as workload, career progression, or compensation.

Support for Female Employees: Evaluate and potentially enhance support systems for female employees, including flexible work options and targeted benefits.

Compensation Review: Re-evaluate the compensation framework to ensure alignment with business goals and employee value, given the low correlation with experience.

# üöÄ Impact
Insights guide HR teams to target high-risk groups with retention strategies, potentially reducing turnover costs.
